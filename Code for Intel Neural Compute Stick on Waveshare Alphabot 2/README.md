# Code for the Intel Neural Compute Stick 2 with Transfer Learning using AWS SageMaker
This code was used on the [Raspberry Pi 3b+](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus/) on a [Waveshare Alphabot2 robot](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/AlphaBot2-Pi). It's runs with an [Intel (Movidius) Neural Compute Stick 2](https://software.intel.com/en-us/neural-compute-stick).

The details of how to train the robot and use the code are in the presentation below:
