# Autonomous Artificial Intelligence in Robotics Meetup
This repository contains presentations I've given at the meetup. They typically show users how to implement some of the technologies associated with creating an autonomous robot.

##About the Meetup
This is a monthly meetup for people who are interested in A.I. in robotics to connect and learn from each other with the potential to discuss possible collaboration opportunities.
